## This repo contains project assignments from my Udacity deep learning nanodegree

[Udacity nanodegree page](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)

Here is an overview of the different projects

P1: Prediction daily bike ridership in a city based on  2 years of data using a neural net.

P2: Classify images based on 10 different labels (CIFIR-10 dataset) using a convolutional neural net.

P3: Create new Simpson transcripts based on existing one using an LSTM neural net.

P4: English to France sentence translator using an LSTM neural net.

P5: Generate new faces using a GAN (CelebA dataset)
